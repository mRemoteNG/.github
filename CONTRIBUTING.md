# Welcome!

We are really glad you are interested in contributing to mRemoteNG!

Open source software is best when shared with others. This also applies to the work that goes into the software. Your ideas and passion are what make this software great.


### Ways you can contribute
There are many ways that you can help improve mRemoteNG, even if you don't know how to program.

For example, you might:
- add documentation or "how-to" articles on the [Wiki](https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki)
- answer support questions on the [forum](http://forum.mremoteng.org)
- [add or improve a translation](https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/How-to-Help-Translating-mRemoteNG)
- submit a [pull request](https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/pulls) for a [bug or feature ticket](https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues)


# Submitting GitHub Issues
The GitHub Issue tracker is our preferred channel for bug reports and feature requests.
- For questions or general discussion, please use [our public Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/mRemoteNG/PublicChat) or the [forum](http://forum.mremoteng.org).
- If you find a security vulnerability, do **NOT** open an issue. Email support@mremoteng.org instead.

### Bug reports
A bug is any behavior that does not consistently produce the expected result.

Guidelines for bug reports:
1. Do not open bug reports for questions.
1. Use the GitHub Issue search to make sure your bug hasn't already been reported.
1. Include as much detailed information as possible. We've included a default template when opening an issue to make this easier.

### Feature requests
Feature requests are great! Take some time to compose a well thought out proposal. It's up to you to convince the project maintainers that your feature is a good idea. To ensure your request receives the consideration that it deserves, include as much detail as possible. For example:
- What is the purpose of the new feature?
- What situation led you to want this feature?
- How does the application perform now and how would the new feature change this?
- If applicable, consider including visual mock-ups to show us what you mean.

# Pull requests
Good pull requests are a huge help! If you haven't already, please consider reading [GitHub's guide to contributing to open source](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/)

Our requests when it comes to pull requests:
- Be clear about what your PR seeks to do.
- Keep your PR focused. It should be clear what code changed to achieve your stated goal.
- Add or update tests when possible. Some of the code base is still very hard to effectively test. If you can, please try to create or update tests that relate to your PR.
- Please talk with one of the project maintainers before starting work on large pull requests. Otherwise, you run the risk of putting a lot of time into a feature or refactor that gets denied.
- If you have access to Static Code Analysis tools (like ReSharper), please don't analyze/fix everything in one giant PR. As great as these tools are, they can sometimes cause unintended problems.

# Code Style
- Please make use of simple types and var where possible
- Prefer "using" over .Dispose()
- Avoid nesting "using"
